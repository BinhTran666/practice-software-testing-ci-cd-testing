# Summary
Sprint5-with-bugs is used to demonstrate how Exploratory Testing 
works. We introduced 40+ bugs (defects) which can be found by using different testing tours.

We also defined user stories that we can use for test planning and test design for exploratory testing sessions.

## Workshop Agenda / Script
1.) 10 days before the training send the homework (see featureList-task.md) to the participants. 
As homework the participants must prepare a feature list from the TestSmith webshop. The featurelist which you should 
use for the training you can find in featureList-overview.md
- Example
    - Feature 1
      - Feature 1.1
      - Feature 1.n
    - Feature 2
    - Feature n
