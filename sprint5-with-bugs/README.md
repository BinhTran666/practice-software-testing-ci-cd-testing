# Summary
Sprint5-with-bugs is used to demonstrate how Exploratory Testing 
works. We introduced 40+ bugs (defects) which can be found by using different testing tours.

We also defined user stories that we can use for test planning and test design for exploratory testing sessions.

## Workshop Agenda / Script
1.) 10 days before the training send the homework (see task-create-featureList.md) to the participants.
